# CPU-StressTest-2.0
A Moderate Stress Test for CPU! It is much more intensive then my last Stress Test code "CPU-StressTest_1.0". It can be stressfull for an old "Quad-Core" and "Dual-Core" CPUs! Although newer CPUs would be most likely able to run it pretty easily without peaking their performance!
# Flexibility
You can Change the time according to your need. By default it is on "60 sec"!
# Warning!!!
Stress Testing a CPU may sometimes lead to a Failure or Damage including "Hardware and Software Failure/Damage"! So If you wanna do stress testing your CPU then do it in the guaidance of a professional and always monitor your Hardware "Usage" & "Temperature"! The author of this code will not be responsible for and Damage or Failure on your system! So if you wanna do it then do it on your own risk!
